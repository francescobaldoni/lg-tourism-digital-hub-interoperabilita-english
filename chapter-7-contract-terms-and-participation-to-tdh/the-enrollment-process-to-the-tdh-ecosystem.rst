*7.3 The Enrollment Process to the TDH Ecosystem*
=================================================

Enrollment of the Ecosystem takes place through a specific digitized
process which involves the participation of the parties involved. In
particular, the member must proceed with the signing of the contractual
model and, if applicable to the specific case, of the related
attachments. The subscription presupposes, as already mentioned, the
recognition of the digital identity of the subscribers, in the forms
governed by the current regulations. **The enrollment process will be
valid for 24 months,** after which the system will communicate to the
adherents the need to re-sign the contractual model. Any adjustments to
the model and / or its annexes, for example resulting from changes to
the reference regulatory framework, will be communicated to the Parties.
