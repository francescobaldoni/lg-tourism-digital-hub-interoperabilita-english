*6.1 Ontologies: An introduction*
=================================

An ontology is a formal representation of knowledge in a specific
domain, which can organize, model and manage information and knowledge,
subsequently sharing and reusing it in one or more domains. The ontology
also allows the definition of a common vocabulary, clarifying the
meaning and correlation between terms and how they relate to each other,
allowing semantic modelling combined with domain knowledge.

Building an ontology within an organization enables the establishing of
standards at an organizational level, creating and improving links
between different domains, thus leading to greater transparency and
better interpretation of data.
