*3.8 API Catalog*\  [1]_
========================

The Guidelines define the Catalog of API TDH022 (in brief, Catalog) as a
single and centralized component, which ensures to the parties involved
in the delivery and use relationship the knowledge of the available
APIs, and for the latter, the declared service levels.

The presence of the Catalog is functional to:

-  facilitate the interoperability between administrations and
   interested private parties;

-  contain government spending by reducing API replication;

-  ensure the declaration of the SLOs by the Provider on the single
   published APIs;

-  express, where present, the commitments between Providers and Users
   relating to the use of APIs (SLA).

The Catalog, without prejudice to the common principles that will be
issued by the Ministry of Tourism, in order to standardize the
technologies used at national level, considers:

-  Specificity of the different areas within which the Ministry of
   Tourism operates through the determination of thematic classes of the
   contents in the Catalog, thus providing aggregations of APIs based on
   different taxonomies. This choice is further justified by the
   opportunity to share common methodologies for the purposes of design
   and development within a common ecosystem (TDH).

-  Need to ensure the governance of the Catalog, as a prerequisite for
   guaranteeing a univocal and shared semantics, to avoid redundancies
   and / or overlaps in terms of competences and contents
   (de-duplication).

-  Need to ensure a formal description of the APIs which, using the
   Interface Description Language (IDL) indicated, allows to describe
   the APIs regardless of the programming language adopted by the
   Provider and Users.
