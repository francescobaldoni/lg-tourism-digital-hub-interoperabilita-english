*3.7 Interoperability patterns and profiles*\  [1]_
===================================================

Guidelines identify:

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| **Interoperability patterns**     | Definition of a solution to a     |
|                                   | need for the exchange of messages |
|                                   | and information, expressed in a   |
|                                   | specific technology               |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| **Interoperability profiles**     | Combination of multiple patterns  |
|                                   | to describe the needs of specific |
|                                   | interoperability domains, such as |
|                                   | the non-repudiation of            |
|                                   | communications and / or exchanged |
|                                   | messages                          |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

The interoperability patterns are divided into:

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| **Interaction patterns**          | Technical methods for             |
|                                   | implementing message exchange     |
|                                   | patterns, necessary for the       |
|                                   | interaction between the IT        |
|                                   | systems of providers and users    |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| **Security profiles**             | Technical methods to ensure that  |
|                                   | the interaction patterns comply   |
|                                   | with specific security            |
|                                   | requirements (authentication and  |
|                                   | authorization of the parties,     |
|                                   | confidentiality of                |
|                                   | communications, integrity of the  |
|                                   | messages exchanged, ...) in the   |
|                                   | exchanges made                    |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

The Patterns and Interoperability Profiles identified in the Operating
Documents of the TDH022 Guidelines are used by the Administrations in
the implementation of their APIs; furthermore, the Administrations
select the Patterns and / or the Interoperability Profiles based on the
specific needs of the interoperability domain in which they participate.
