*3.9 Model Governance*\  [1]_
=============================

The Ministry of Tourism is responsible for governance activities with
the aim of defining, sharing and ensuring the continuous updating of the
following aspects:

-  the set of technologies that enable interoperability between the
   members of the Ecosystem;

-  the Interoperability patterns (interaction and safety);

-  the Interoperability profiles;

-  the set of Taxonomies and Ontologies.

The relationship between Users and Providers is made explicit through
the Catalog.

Adhesion to the TDH takes place by signing the relevant Agreement, which
governs the roles, responsibilities and obligations of the Parties.
Without prejudice to the uses permitted to MiTur within the scope of the
TDH, the use of the API of a Provider by a User in contexts and for
purposes unrelated to the TDH is subject to a further Authorization by
the Provider itself, which it will be managed digitally with a specific
procedure on the TDH.

Providers must describe their e-services by classifying the information
exchanged (where possible by linking it to controlled vocabularies and
semantic concepts defined at national and / or international level) and
apply labels that identify the category.

A Provider can delegate the registration of e-services within the
Catalog to another subject (Regional and / or Local Administrations,
Entities or Third Parties) in relation to specific territorial contexts
and / or thematic areas.

The API Catalog allows Public and Private entities to know the
e-services available and their delivery and use methods within the
ecosystem.

The Ministry of Tourism has the role of:

-  acknowledge the interoperability needs of Regional and / or Local
   Administrations, Entities or Third Parties, abstract them and
   eventually formalize new patterns and / or profiles of
   interoperability;

-  coordinate the process of defining the interoperability profiles and
   patterns;

-  make the Catalog available, through a single access interface to
   allow all interested parties, public and private, to know the
   available e-services;

-  request the adoption of Interoperability Patterns and Profiles for
   the implementation of APIs as a condition for registering with the
   Catalog, as well as continuously checking compliance with the
   requirements for registering with the Catalog itself.
