*3.4 Service Level Agreement (SLA)*\  [1]_
==========================================

The integration may involve numerous TDH adherents who expose their
APIs. To align on QoS, providers and users of APIs use what are known as
Service Level Agreements (SLAs), or service level agreements. An SLA
consists of the following elements:

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| **Purpose**                       | Reasons that led to the           |
|                                   | definition of the SLA             |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| **Parties**                       | Interested parties and respective |
|                                   | roles (e.g., API provider and     |
|                                   | user)                             |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| **Validity period**               | Time interval, expressed by start |
|                                   | date and time, end date and time, |
|                                   | for which a particular term of    |
|                                   | agreement is considered valid     |
|                                   | within the SLAs                   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| **Perimeter**                     | Operations affected by the        |
|                                   | specific SLA                      |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| **Service Level Objectives        | The individual terms of agreement |
| (SLO)**                           | within an SLA. Usually, they are  |
|                                   | defined using Service Level       |
|                                   | Indicators (SLI), or service      |
|                                   | level indicators, which quantify  |
|                                   | the individual aspects of QoS     |
|                                   | (e.g., availability)              |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| **Penalties**                     | Sanctions that apply if the       |
|                                   | service interface provider does   |
|                                   | not ensure the objectives         |
|                                   | specified in the SLA              |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| **Exclusions**                    | Aspects of QoS not covered by     |
|                                   | SLAs                              |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| **Administration**                | Processes by which parties can    |
|                                   | monitor QoS                       |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

SLAs can be static or dynamic. In dynamic SLAs, the SLOs (with
associated SLI) vary over time and the validity periods define the
validity intervals of the latter (e.g., during working hours the SLOs
can be different from those set during the night). The measurement of
QoS levels within an SLA requires the tracking of operations carried out
in a multi-domain infrastructure context (geographical, technological
and applicational).
