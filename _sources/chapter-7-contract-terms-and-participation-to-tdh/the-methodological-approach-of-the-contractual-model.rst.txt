*7.2 The methodological approach of the contractual model*
==========================================================

The methodological approach for enrolling in the Ecosystem takes into
consideration the particular elements that concern the individual
categories of actors, institutional and non-institutional, data and
information flows that will be part of the operational model of the
Ecosystem itself. The approach is therefore modular and aims to minimize
the administrative burden on the parties involved, in view of the role
they actually play in the Ecosystem. As the complexity and variety of
the exchanged data and flows increase, the model responds with the
definition of further technical annexes to the main contractual model,
which regulate the most complex cases of interaction, namely those
enabling the design and implementation of new services by Second and
Third Parties. The methodological approach also includes a support to
the adherent parts of procedural, functional and technical nature.
