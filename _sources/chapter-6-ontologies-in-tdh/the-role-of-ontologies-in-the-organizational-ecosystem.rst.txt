*6.2 The role of Ontologies in the organizational ecosystem*
============================================================

The role of the ontology is to play the role of the "common driver"
between existing and potential data sources inside the Ecosystem, and in
particular in TDH. The main objective of ontology development is to
identify the smallest number of entities needed to ensure a high level
of data inter-operability.

Building an ontology leads mainly to two advantages:

-  Stakeholders agree on common vocabulary used to describe components,

-  Different systems, databases and applications, can communicate
   without having to connect to each other.

These two features enable the development of new information systems
within TDH022 through faster and more efficient data exchange,
facilitating integration between data from different sources.
