*3.1 Interactions*\  [1]_
=========================

The scope of application of these Guidelines, in line with the
Interoperability Model of Italian Public Administrations *(ModI: Model
created by AgID which enables the collaboration between Public
Administrations and between these and third parties by means of
technological solutions that ensure interaction and exchange of
information without constraints on implementations, avoiding ad hoc
integrations)*, includes the three types of interactions envisaged in
the EIF that involve Public Administrations, Citizens and Companies.

The ways of interaction with the TDH Ecosystem will allow both the use
of (open) digital services available inside it and the development /
delivery of new ones (open or closed) by making them available to those
participating in the Ecosystem. In this sense, the interactions provide
that the operators (public and private) adhering to the TDH022 can
perform the function of **service provider** and **user of the
services**, as previously described. In this sense it is possible for a
tour operator to perform one or both functions.

The users can use the digital services made available by the service
providers, who have evidence of their use through specific control
mechanisms such as:

-  a software solution that includes a control mechanism operated by a
   specific operator in the back end of the Platform (user agent /
   human);

-  an automatic application system (server / machine), also for the
   purpose of defining new value-added services (connection via API).
