*3.5 Interoperability domain*\  [1]_
====================================

In the context of these Guidelines, the interoperability domain means a
specific context in which several Administrations and / or Private
entities need to exchange data and / or integrate their processes to
follow up on the regulatory provisions.

Each interoperability domain is characterized by:

-  the participating subjects, the Administrations and Institutions
   (including the Ministry of Tourism and ENIT) and any private subjects
   (citizens and businesses);

-  the IT systems of the participating parties that exchange data and /
   or integrate their own processes;

-  the set of APIs implemented to ensure interactions between the IT
   systems of the participating parties;

-  the security criteria that the single APIs provide to ensure
   transactions between participating parties that comply with the
   standard.
